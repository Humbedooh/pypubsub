# ACL for authenticated users

# in this example, username testuser with password foobar has access to two separate pubsub contexts
testuser:
  password: foobar
  acl:
    # Allow sample access to events for a private git repository called privaterepo.git
    # Topics are AND'ed together and create a common denominator for what the client has access to.
    # Thus, the below grants access to git/privaterepo.git, but not git/otherrepo.git
    # You can name/title these segments as you see fit.
    title_of_my_first_access_segment:
      - git
      - privaterepo.git
    # Allow access to events for dev@example.org mailing list
    allow_email_access_for_foobar:
      - email
      - example.org
      - dev
  # Explicitly allow this user to publish topics 'foo' and 'bar', even if they are secured.
  topics:
    - foo
    - bar
